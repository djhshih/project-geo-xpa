Basecalling was done by Illumina analysis pipeline CASAVA (version 1.8.2).
The reads were mapped to the human genome (hg19) using TopHat (version 2.0.10).
The number of fragments in each gene from the RefSeq database (downloaded from UCSC Genome Browser on July 17, 2015) was enumerated using htseq-count from the HTSeq software package (version 0.6.0).
